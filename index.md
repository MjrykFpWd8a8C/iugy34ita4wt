Personalities
The term personality has been applied to human research, whereas the term temperament has been mostly used for animal research.[19] However, both terms have been used interchangeably in the literature, or purely to distinguish humans from animals and avoid anthropomorphism.[20] Personality can be defined as “a set of behaviors that are consistent over context and time”.[21] Studies of dogs' personalities have tried to identify the presence of broad personality traits that are stable and consistent over time.[20][21][22][23]

There are different approaches to assess dog personality:

Ratings of individual dogs: either a caretaker or a dog expert who is familiar with the dog is asked to answer a questionnaire, for instance the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire,[24] concerning how often the dog shows certain types of behavior.
Tests: the dog is submitted to a set of tests and its reactions are evaluated on a behavioral scale. For instance, the dog is presented to a familiar and then an unfamiliar person in order to measure sociability or aggression.[25]
Observational test: The dog’s behavior is evaluated in a selected but not controlled environment. An observer focuses on the dog’s reactions to naturally occurring stimuli. For example, a walk through the supermarket can allow the observer to see the dog in various types of conditions (crowded, noisy…)[26]
